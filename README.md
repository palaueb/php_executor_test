# Test suite

/!\ If you try to execute your code, provably you will get frustrated.

This is a TOY project, the main objective is to be able to emulate the execution of a PHP project to be able to modify the behavior of the execution.

If you are searching for something serious, try xdebug for PHP. There are tons of serious projecs. Don't bother me with bugs or diregards about what is wrong, I DON'T CARE.

Enjoy.
